================================================================================

ISSUE #1: Missing Conflict of Interest Statement
  Severity: MINOR (but required for ACM)
  Location: Section 1 metadata
  Current: Not stated
  Fix: Add statement like: "Anthropic has commercial interest in YAWL 
        technology and has developed proprietary extensions."
  Time: 5 minutes
  Impact: HIGH (prevents reviewer concern)

ISSUE #2: No Confidence Intervals in Results
  Severity: MINOR (statistical best practice)
  Location: Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
  Current: Mean and percentile values only
  Fix: Add 95% CI using bootstrap method (1000 iterations)
  Time: 30 minutes
  Impact: MEDIUM (strengthens statistical rigor)

ISSUE #3: Missing Hardware Specifications
  Severity: MINOR (reproducibility requirement)
  Location: Section 3 Methodology
  Current: JVM configuration provided; hardware specs absent
  Fix: Add section 3.0 EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT with:
       - CPU model (e.g., 12-core Intel Xeon, ARM M2)
       - Memory type (DDR4, DDR5)
       - Storage type (SSD model, IOPS rating)
       - Network (Gigabit, measured latency)
       - OS version (Linux 5.15.0, macOS 14.x, etc.)
       - Java build (OpenJDK 25.0.1+8)
       - YAWL commit hash (stable release tag)
  Time: 10 minutes
  Impact: MEDIUM (reproducibility)

ISSUE #4: No Data Availability Statement
  Severity: MINOR (open science requirement)
  Location: End of document or metadata section
  Current: Not stated
  Fix: Add statement like: "All code and raw data available at 
       https://github.com/anthropic-ai/yawl-million-case-validation"
  Time: 5 minutes
  Impact: MEDIUM (open science perception)

ISSUE #5: Abstract Length Below Target
  Severity: VERY MINOR (formatting)
  Location: Section 1.0 ABSTRACT
  Current: ~130 words
  Target: 180-200 words for journal submissions
  Fix: Expand with:
       - One sentence on Java 25 enablement
       - One sentence on safety margin (1.8× breaking point)
       - More detail on database bottleneck finding
  Time: 15 minutes
  Impact: LOW (readability)

ISSUE #6: Missing Table of Contents
  Severity: VERY MINOR (navigation)
  Location: After metadata section
  Current: Not present
  Fix: Add formal TOC for journal submission format
  Time: 5 minutes
  Impact: LOW (journal formatting)
