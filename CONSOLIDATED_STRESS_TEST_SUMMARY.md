## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Virtual Thread Scalability**: 2.61x improvement at scale
2. **Memory Efficiency**: 99.9% reduction per thread
3. **High Throughput**: 100K+ operations/sec
4. **Low Latency**: P95 < 100ms for most operations
5. **Zero Virtual Thread Pinning**: Clean migration path

### Areas Requiring Attention
1. **Case Creation Throughput**: 75.8 ops/sec (target: 760 ops/sec)
2. **Session Memory**: 24.93KB (target: <10KB)
3. **Security Test Edge Cases**: 11 false positives
4. **GraalPy Test Syntax**: Illegal characters in test files
