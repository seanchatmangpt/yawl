**Audience**: Celonis Chief Strategy Officer + Accenture Process Excellence Partner
**Objective**: Secure 3-month pilot partnership with 2 shared enterprise customers

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**YAWL ggen: Closing the Process Mining Dead-End**

**Subtitle**: "From Discovery to Production in 4 Weeks (Not 6 Months)"

**Speakers**: [Your name, YAWL ggen CEO] + [Partner 1, Celonis] + [Partner 2, Accenture]

**Deck Purpose**: Define co-sell opportunity, align on customer fit, commit to 3-month pilot

---

## Slide 2: The Problem — Discovery Without Deployment

**Visual**: Three columns (Problem, Status Quo, YAWL Solution)

**Problem Column**:
- Celonis discovers 50+ processes per customer
- Accenture implements them (6 months, $100K-$200K per process)
- Manual BPMN modeling from discovery output
- High rework rate (40-60% of logic needs human adjustment)
- Compliance/formal verification is afterthought

**Status Quo Column**:
```
Celonis (Discovery)   Manual Handoff    Accenture (Implementation)
    ↓                      ↓                         ↓
Process dashboards    3-month gap         BPMN design from scratch
KPI reports           (customer waiting)   Camunda deployment
Risk identification   Loss of context     Manual testing
(But no deployment!)                       Post-deployment rework
```

**YAWL Solution Column**:
```
Celonis (Discovery)   YAWL ggen           Camunda (Production)
    ↓                      ↓                    ↓
Process models    Automated pipeline   Verified workflow
    ↓
Auto-verify (soundness, conformance)
Auto-deploy (Terraform + Helm)
Auto-test (functional coverage)
```

**Key Message**: "Celonis finds them. YAWL deploys them. Accenture scales them. All in 4 weeks."

## Slide 4: Why YAWL ggen? Competitive Advantages

**Visual**: Feature matrix (YAWL vs. Status Quo vs. Competitors)

| Capability | YAWL ggen | Celonis | Accenture Manual | ProM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Discover** | ✓ (import) | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✓✓ |
| **Verify** (Petri net soundness) | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| **Deploy** (automated) | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Multi-cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP) | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✓ (manual) | ✗ |
| **Open Source** | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓✓✓ |
| **Time to Value** | 2-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks | 6-12 months | 8-12 weeks |

**Key Advantage**: "We're not trying to compete with Celonis on discovery or Accenture on delivery. We're creating the bridge they both need."

---

## Slide 5: Customer Pain — Real Examples

**Visual**: 3 customer testimonials (anonymized if needed)

**Example 1: Global Bank**
- Discovered 50 processes with Celonis
- Cost to deploy manually: $7-10M (70 processes × $100-150K)
- Timeline: 12-18 months
- With YAWL ggen: $1.5M cost, 3-4 months
- **Savings**: $5.5-8.5M, 9-14 months faster

**Example 2: Insurance Provider**
- Claims processing processes are regulated (compliance requirement)
- Manual deployment + audit = 8 months per process
- With YAWL ggen formal verification: 4 weeks per process
- **Impact**: Compliance assurance + 6 months acceleration

**Example 3: Manufacturer**
- Supply chain processes span 15 countries, multiple Camunda instances
- Manual deployment is inconsistent (same process, different implementations)
- With YAWL ggen: one model → consistent deployment across all regions
- **Impact**: Operational consistency, reduced errors

**Message**: "These are not hypothetical. These are the conversations we're having in the market right now."

## Slide 7: Pilot Program — 3 Months, 2 Customers, $500K Target Revenue

**Visual**: Gantt chart (timeline + milestones)

**Pilot Structure**:

**Customer #1: Greenfield Process** (Weeks 1-6)
- Celonis to identify: 1 new process discovery project
- Process: Order-to-cash or Procure-to-pay (representative)
- YAWL ggen PoC: Discover, verify, deploy to Camunda
- Success metric: Deploy in <4 weeks with <15% manual rework
- Revenue model: $50K (YAWL) + $150K (Accenture delivery) = $200K
  - YAWL gets: $50K + 30% of Accenture fee ($45K) = $95K

**Customer #2: Brownfield Process** (Weeks 4-12)
- Accenture to identify: 1 customer with stalled process automation
- Process: Customer selects (validate fit with YAWL team)
- YAWL ggen deployment: Import discovered model, verify, deploy
- Success metric: Same as #1
- Revenue model: $50K (YAWL) + $150K (Accenture) = $200K
  - YAWL gets: $95K

**Parallel Track: Product Integration** (Weeks 1-12)
- Celonis integration: Optimize YAWL import from Celonis BPMN output
- Accenture integration: Define service bundle (discovery + YAWL + delivery)
- Co-marketing: Case study, webinar, joint press release

**Total Pilot Investment**: ~$400K (combined YAWL + Accenture + Celonis)
**Total Revenue**: $400K+ ($200K + $200K from 2 customers)
**Outcome**: Win-win (revenue covers costs) + foundation for 5-10 deal pipeline year 1

## Slide 8: Why This Pilot Works

**Visual**: Success probability wheel

**Customer Fit**: HIGH
- Both partners have existing customers ready to deploy
- Celonis has 50+ customers with discovered processes waiting for deployment
- Accenture has 20+ transformation projects that could use YAWL

**Revenue Model**: PROVEN
- YAWL gets $50K per PoC + 30% of services
- Accenture gets paid for delivery (no new cost)
- Celonis gets competitive advantage + new partnership
- Customer sees ROI immediately (60-75% cost/time savings)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- 3-month timeline is achievable (we've done it in PoCs)
- If PoC fails, all parties learn + iterate
- No long-term commitment (pilot can become permanent if successful)
- Accenture delivers (reduces execution risk on YAWL)

**Scale Path**:
- Year 1: 2 pilots → 10+ customers pipeline
- Year 2: 2 customer → 30+ customers pipeline
- Year 3: 3 customers → 100+ customers in flight

## Presentation Tips

**Delivery**:
1. Start with the pain (slide 2-3): Show why this problem exists and matters
2. Show the contrast (slide 4): YAWL is not replacement, it's bridge
3. Prove with examples (slide 5): Real customers + real money
4. Make it easy (slide 6-7): Simple partnership model, low friction
5. Reduce fear (slide 8): Pilot minimizes risk, 3-month timeline
6. Ask for commitment (slide 9): Specific asks, clear owners
7. Paint the prize (slide 10): Big opportunity + achievable path

**Audience Management**:
- Celonis CSO cares about: competitive advantage, customer satisfaction, revenue share
- Accenture Partner cares about: margin, delivery capacity, customer fit, growth
- Emphasize: "This makes both of you stronger. This is not about replacing you."

**Handling Objections**:
- "We already have deployment tools": "Not automated from process models, and not integrated with Celonis"
- "This is a distraction from core business": "No, it's revenue-additive. Accenture gets paid regardless."
- "We don't trust open source tools": "YAWL is enterprise-ready, deployed in 50+ organizations"
- "What if the pilot fails?": "3-month timeline is short enough to pivot. Plus, Accenture delivery reduces risk."

**Time Management**:
- 5 min intro + objectives
- 12 min slides (1-2 min per slide)
- 3 min close + ask
