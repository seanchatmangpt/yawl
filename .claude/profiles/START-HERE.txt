PROJECT STATUS
==============
✅ Phase 1: Validation Harness - COMPLETE
⏳ Phase 2: YEngine Investigation - READY TO START

QUICKEST PATH (2 minutes)
=========================
1. Read: QUICK-START.md (this directory)
2. Run:  bash ../../scripts/validate-yengine-parallelization.sh
3. Done! You now know if parallelization is safe.

WHAT YOU GET
============
✅ 9 isolation tests (YEngineParallelizationTest.java)
✅ One-command validation script
✅ Complete decision framework
✅ Detailed documentation
✅ Rollback procedures
✅ Team messaging templates

CORE FILES (You Need These)
===========================
Test Code:
  ../../src/test/java/org/yawlfoundation/yawl/validation/
  └── YEngineParallelizationTest.java (9 tests, 673 lines)

Automation:
  ../../scripts/validate-yengine-parallelization.sh (executable)

Documentation (Start with QUICK-START.md):
  QUICK-START.md                    (one-page overview)
  VALIDATION-HARNESS-README.md      (complete guide)
  PARALLELIZATION-DECISION.md       (strategic framework)
  yengine-validation-checklist.md   (Phase 2 guidance)
  DELIVERY-SUMMARY.md               (what was delivered)
  TEAM-MESSAGE-TEMPLATE.md          (ready-to-send messages)
  INDEX.md                          (navigation guide)

NEXT STEPS BY ROLE
==================

IF YOU ARE: Validation Engineer
  1. ✅ Review test code (YEngineParallelizationTest.java)
  2. ✅ Verify script is executable (ls -l ../../scripts/...)
  3. → Message team: "Validation harness ready for Phase 2"
  4. → Use TEAM-MESSAGE-TEMPLATE.md for exact wording

IF YOU ARE: YEngine Investigator
  1. → Read: QUICK-START.md (2 min)
  2. → Run: bash ../../scripts/validate-yengine-parallelization.sh (30 sec)
  3. → Review: Results in validation-reports/ directory
  4. → Deep dive: Follow Phase 2 guidance in yengine-validation-checklist.md
  5. → Decide: GO or NO-GO based on findings
  6. → Report: Message team with recommendation

IF YOU ARE: Build Optimizer
  1. ← Wait for Phase 2 GO decision from investigator
  2. → Update pom.xml for parallel execution (-T flag)
  3. → Test locally with -T 1.5C
  4. → Document changes

IF YOU ARE: Team Lead
  1. → Read: PARALLELIZATION-DECISION.md (10 min)
  2. → Monitor: Phase 2 investigation progress
  3. → Wait: For GO/NO-GO decision
  4. → Decide: Proceed with Phase 3-5 if GO

VALIDATION QUICK START
======================
$ cd /home/user/yawl
$ bash scripts/validate-yengine-parallelization.sh

Exit codes:
  0 = PASS (safe to parallelize)
  1 = FAIL (keep sequential, fix issues)
  2 = ERROR (validation harness problem, manual review)

Results go to: .claude/profiles/validation-reports/parallelization-report-*.txt

UNDERSTANDING THE TESTS
=======================
T1: Static field pollution         (Detects field pollution across tests)
T2: Singleton thread safety        (Verifies getInstance() safe in threads)
T3: Case state cross-contamination (Detects case ID collisions)
T4: Spec loading races             (Catches duplicate spec IDs)
T5: Intentional corruption         (Proves detector works)
T6: ThreadLocal pollution          (Validates tenant context isolation)
T7: Case completion leaks          (Detects state leakage)
T8: Memory leak detection          (Checks heap growth)
T9: Database connection isolation  (Verifies connection pool)

GO/NO-GO DECISION
=================
GO (Safe to parallelize):
  - All 9 tests PASS
  - 0 corruptions detected
  - All GO conditions met (see yengine-validation-checklist.md)
  
NO-GO (Keep sequential):
  - Any test fails
  - Any corruption detected
  - Any NO-GO blocker found

DOCUMENT READING GUIDE
======================
Choose based on what you need:

Just want the basics?
  → QUICK-START.md (2-3 minutes)

Need complete guide?
  → VALIDATION-HARNESS-README.md (15 minutes)

Want strategy & phases?
  → PARALLELIZATION-DECISION.md (20 minutes)

Leading Phase 2 investigation?
  → yengine-validation-checklist.md (30 minutes+)

What was delivered?
  → DELIVERY-SUMMARY.md (10 minutes)

Need to message team?
  → TEAM-MESSAGE-TEMPLATE.md (copy & customize)

Lost or confused?
  → INDEX.md (navigation guide)

HOW TO USE VALIDATION RESULTS
=============================
If PASS (exit code 0):
  ✅ Parallelization is safe
  ✅ Proceed to Phase 2
  ✅ Message team with positive result
  
If FAIL (exit code 1):
  ✅ Parallelization not safe yet
  ✅ Review report: validation-reports/parallelization-report-*.txt
  ✅ Alert YEngine Investigator with findings
  ✅ Wait for Phase 2 analysis
  
If ERROR (exit code 2):
  ✅ Validation harness had an issue
  ✅ Manual review required
  ✅ Check logs for details
  ✅ May need help from team

KEY METRICS
===========
After running validation, look for:
  - Corruption count: Must be 0 for GO
  - Test results: All T1-T9 must pass
  - Lock contention: Should be <10%
  - Memory growth: Should be <100MB per test
  - DB connections: Should be properly isolated
  - ThreadLocal cleanup: No pollution

TIMELINE
========
Phase 1 (Now):     Validation Harness        ✅ COMPLETE
Phase 2 (Week 1):  YEngine Investigation    ⏳ READY TO START
Phase 3 (Day 5):   Build Configuration      ⏳ If Phase 2 GO
Phase 4 (Day 6):   Canary Parallel Run      ⏳ If Phase 3 done
Phase 5 (Day 7):   Production Deployment    ⏳ If Phase 4 good

BENEFITS WHEN COMPLETE
======================
Build time: 2-3 min (sequential) → ~1 min (parallel)
Developer experience: Faster PR feedback, quicker iterations
CI/CD pipeline: 3× faster feedback cycle
Test coverage: No loss - all tests still run
Quality: Same rigor, safer parallelization

SUPPORT
=======
Questions?
  1. Check the appropriate guide (see "Document Reading Guide" above)
  2. Look in INDEX.md for navigation help
  3. Search VALIDATION-HARNESS-README.md for FAQ section
  4. Review TEAM-MESSAGE-TEMPLATE.md for examples

Found an issue?
  1. Run validation again with --verbose flag
  2. Check validation-reports/ directory
  3. Review critical-failures.log if present
  4. Document findings for Phase 2 investigator

FINAL CHECKLIST
===============
□ Read QUICK-START.md (orientation)
□ Run validation script (get baseline)
□ Review results
□ Take appropriate action based on result
□ Message team with next steps

You are here: START-HERE.txt

Next: Read QUICK-START.md (2 minutes)
Then:  Run validation script (30 seconds)
Done:  Know if parallelization is safe!
