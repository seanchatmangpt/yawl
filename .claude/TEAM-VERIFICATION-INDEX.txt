DELIVERABLES SUMMARY
====================

This package contains 6 documents designed to launch a 5-engineer verification
team for comprehensive build system consistency audit. The team will verify that:
- dx.sh CLI implementation
- pom.xml module organization  
- reactor.json canonical ordering
- DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md quality gates
- Mermaid diagrams (if present)
...are all consistent with each other and with 15 new Diátaxis documentation.

THE 5 ORTHOGONAL QUANTUMS
=========================

QUANTUM 1: Reactor Order & Dependency Graph (Engineer A, 25 min)
  Focus: pom.xml vs reactor.json module sequence, topological sort, cycles
  Key Files: pom.xml (61-81), reactor.json, DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md §3.1
  Success: 19 modules verified, dependencies valid, no cycles
  Integration: Points A, C

QUANTUM 2: CLI Flags & Environment Variables (Engineer B, 22 min)
  Focus: dx.sh command parsing, env vars, Java 25 enforcement
  Key Files: dx.sh (entire), dx-workflow.md
  Success: All CLI modes documented, env vars match implementation
  Integration: Point C

QUANTUM 3: Parallel Build Groups & Critical Path (Engineer C, 25 min)
  Focus: -T 1.5C parallelism, layer structure, critical path, <90s target
  Key Files: reactor.json, DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md §3.1, dx-workflow.md
  Success: Layers enable parallel builds, critical path identified
  Integration: Points A, B, C

QUANTUM 4: Build Profiles & Quality Gates (Engineer D, 28 min)
  Focus: 6 Maven profiles (java25, agent-dx, ci, analysis, security, prod)
  Key Files: pom.xml (profiles), DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md §2-3
  Success: All 6 profiles exist, 7 gates mapped to commands
  Integration: Points A, B

QUANTUM 5: Definition of Done & Enforcement (Engineer E, 30 min)
  Focus: 7 gates, H-set (8 patterns), Q-invariant, enforcement via hooks
  Key Files: DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md (all), HYPER_STANDARDS.md, hyper-validate.sh
  Success: All 7 gates measurable, H-set integrated, Q-invariant enforced
  Integration: Points B, C

INTEGRATION POINTS
==================

POINT A: Reactor Order Canonical Form
  Engineers: A (reactor), C (parallelism), D (gates)
  Question: Do pom.xml, reactor.json, DEFINITION-OF-DONE all agree?
  Success: Same 19-module sequence, same layers, no cycles

POINT B: Gate Execution Commands & Timing
  Engineers: C (parallelism), D (profiles), E (gates)
  Question: Do gates use correct profiles/parallelism within <90s?
  Success: -T 1.5C flag used, correct profile, timing achievable

POINT C: CLI Argument Contracts & Parallelism
  Engineers: B (CLI), C (parallelism), A (reactor)
  Question: Does dx.sh -pl correctly invoke mvn -pl -amd?
  Success: -amd flag included, affected modules included, order respected

EXPECTED OUTPUTS
================

After team execution (~50 min), you'll have:

✓ 5 engineer verification reports (with findings, evidence, status)
✓ COMPREHENSIVE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md (lead synthesis, full evidence trail)
✓ Integration point alignment verification (Points A, B, C)
✓ End-to-end build validation (dx.sh all green)
✓ Inconsistency manifest (any issues identified + fix priority)
✓ Git commit with artifacts and session URL

TIMELINE
========

T+0 min   : Lead briefs team on 5 quantums and integration points
T+5 min   : All 5 engineers start parallel work
T+35 min  : Engineers report findings
T+40 min  : Lead validates integration points
T+45 min  : Lead synthesizes COMPREHENSIVE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
T+50 min  : dx.sh all validation + commit

✓ Artifacts committed with team ID and session URL

QUICK START FOR LEAD
====================

2. During (30 min):
   - Monitor: Engineer progress (status every 5-10 min)
   - Watch: For blockers or RED findings
   - Flag: Unexpected conflicts

3. Post-team (15-20 min):
   - Collect: Engineer reports
   - Validate: Integration points A, B, C
   - Synthesize: COMPREHENSIVE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
   - Validate: dx.sh all green
   - Commit: Artifacts

2. Review TEAM-VERIFICATION-VISUAL.md for team structure
3. Use TEAM-VERIFICATION-ASSIGNMENTS.md to brief engineers
4. Consult LEAD-VERIFICATION-BRIEFING.md when making decisions
5. Reference TEAM-VERIFICATION-QUICK-REF.yaml for quick lookups
6. Keep TEAM-VERIFICATION-STRUCTURE.json as formal spec

Cost: $3-4C (5 engineers × 25-30 min parallel + 15 min consolidation)
ROI: Comprehensive build system consistency verified
