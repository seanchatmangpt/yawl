 * YAWL Reactor Integration - Reactive Programming Support
 *
 * Copyright 2004-2026 The YAWL Foundation
 *
 * @since 6.0.0-GA
 *
 * This package provides reactive programming integration for YAWL, featuring:
 * - Project Reactor integration with Flux/Mono reactive types
 * - Backpressure handling for high-throughput workflows
 * - Non-blocking I/O for improved performance
 * - Stream processing for event-driven workflows
 * - Reactive error handling and recovery mechanisms
 *
 * The Reactor integration enables YAWL to handle complex
 * asynchronous workflows efficiently, supporting:
 * - Streaming data processing
 * - Event-driven architecture patterns
 * - Concurrency with thread-per-task efficiency
 * - Real-time workflow monitoring
 * - Resource-efficient workflow execution
 *
 * MCP/A2A Integration:
 * This package supports Message Passing and Agent-to-Agent communication
 * patterns through reactive streams, enabling seamless integration
 * with external reactive systems.
