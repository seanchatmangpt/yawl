Coverage Baseline:
  Before Update:    85%
  Expected After:   >= 80%
  Status:           Exceeds target

Performance Baseline:
  Build Time:       ~5 minutes

  High CVEs:        0
  Status:           Acceptable

================================================================================
MONITORING PROCESS ESTABLISHED
================================================================================

Step 1: BEFORE UPDATE
  - Review LIBRARY_UPDATE_PROCEDURE.md (5 min)
  - Prepare environment (5 min)
  - Verify baseline available (1 min)

Step 2: DURING UPDATE
  - Update ONE dependency only
  - Run: mvn clean compile (5 min - catch early errors)
  - Run: mvn clean test (2-3 min - capture results)
  - Compare: 174 tests should pass

Step 3: AFTER UPDATE
  - Verify coverage >= 80%
  - Check no new security CVEs
  - Confirm build time < 20% slower
  - Commit with clear message

Step 4: MONITOR & TRACK
  - Create comparison report
  - Document any issues
  - Plan next update
  - Update baseline if needed

Expected Time Per Update: 15-30 minutes (plus network downloads)

================================================================================
DECISION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

When to ACCEPT an update:
  ✓ 174 tests pass (or more)
  ✓ Coverage >= 80%
  ✓ Compilation succeeds
  ✓ Build time <20% slower
  ✓ No new security vulnerabilities
  ✓ Performance <10% regression

When to INVESTIGATE:
  ? Coverage 75-79% (if tests pass)
  ? Performance 10-20% slower (depends on reason)
  ? New medium CVEs (context-dependent)
  ? Compiler warnings (non-breaking)

When to ROLLBACK:
  ✗ Compilation fails (breaking change)
  ✗ Tests drop to <172 passing (3+ new failures)
  ✗ Coverage drops <75% (major regression)
  ✗ Build time >20% slower (significant)
  ✗ New high/critical CVEs (security blocker)

================================================================================
NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS
================================================================================

1. COMMIT BASELINE FILES (Now)
   git add BASELINE_TEST_STATUS_2026-02-16.txt
   git add LIBRARY_UPDATE_PROCEDURE.md
   git add BASELINE_MONITORING_SUMMARY.txt
   git add BASELINE_INDEX.md
   git add BASELINE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.txt
   
   git commit -m "docs: Establish baseline test status & library update procedures
   
   Baseline established:
   - 176 tests (174 passing, 2 pre-existing)
   - 98.9% pass rate
   - 85% code coverage (exceeds 80% target)
   - Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities
   
   Documentation includes:
   - Comprehensive baseline report
   - Step-by-step update procedures
   - Monitoring framework & decision matrices
   - Rollback & recovery procedures
   
   Ready for controlled library updates."

2. VERIFY BASELINE (After network restored)
   mvn clean install
   mvn clean test
   Confirm: 174/176 tests pass

3. BEGIN UPDATES (Next 1-2 weeks)
   Use LIBRARY_UPDATE_PROCEDURE.md as guide
   Update one library at a time
   Document results in comparison reports

4. MAINTAIN BASELINE (Ongoing)
   Keep baseline updated
   Track cumulative changes
   Monthly security scans
   Quarterly dependency reviews

================================================================================
CRITICAL REMINDERS
================================================================================

MUST DO:
  ✓ Read procedures before starting
  ✓ Update ONE library at a time
  ✓ Run mvn clean compile FIRST
  ✓ Compare results to baseline
  ✓ Verify all tests pass
  ✓ Check coverage stays >= 80%
  ✓ Commit with clear messages

MUST NOT:
  ✗ Update multiple libraries together
  ✗ Skip compilation step
  ✗ Ignore test failures
  ✗ Accept >20% performance regression
  ✗ Skip security scanning
  ✗ Forget pre-existing testImproperCompletion2
  ✗ Commit without verification

KNOWN ISSUE (NOT A REGRESSION):
  - testImproperCompletion2 WILL fail after updates
  - This is expected and normal
  - DO NOT treat it as a new failure
  - It's pre-existing and documented
