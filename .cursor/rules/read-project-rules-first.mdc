# Read Project Rules First

## Before any build, test, run, or environment assumptions

1. **Read project rules at task start.** Check `.cursorrules` (and `CLAUDE.md` if present) before proposing or executing commands, scripts, or "how to run" instructions.
2. **Respect environment constraints.** If the project states it is Docker/devcontainer-only (or host-only, or CI-only), do not suggest or document running on the host, "locally", or "in the terminal" without specifying the correct environment (e.g. "inside the devcontainer" or "inside `docker compose run yawl-dev`").
3. **Never assume the host has runtimes.** When project rules say "all build/test/run inside the container", do not add scripts or plans that assume Java, Ant, Node, etc. on the host unless the rules explicitly allow it.

## Why

- Cursor injects rules into context, but the agent must treat them as authoritative. Ignoring `.cursorrules` leads to wrong environment assumptions (e.g. local vs container).
- Best practice (Cursor docs): project rules are version-controlled and scoped to the codebase; they define where and how code runs.

## This project

- **YAWL:** Docker/devcontainer-only per `.cursorrules`. All build, test, and run happen **inside** the devcontainer or `yawl-dev`. Never say "run locally" or "on your machine" without "inside the container".
