# NOTE: The oauth.consumerKey and oauth.consumerSecret values below identify the YAWL
# TwitterService and should not be changed.  The oauth.accessToken and
# oauth.accessTokenSecret values below are those for the default twitter user YAWLProc.
# To use the service with a different twitter account, replace the oauth.accessToken
# and oauth.accessTokenSecret values below with those of the other account. A simple
# guide to generating tokens for another twitter account can be found here:

# Credentials must be injected via environment variables from secure vault. NEVER commit actual OAuth tokens.
# Revoked Twitter OAuth keys on 2026-02-17 due to accidental exposure in git history. See DEPLOYMENT.md.
