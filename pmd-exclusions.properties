# YAWL PMD Exclusion Properties
#
# Format: <filepath>=<comma-separated rule FQNs>
#
# These exclusions are for known, accepted violations that either:
#   a) Predate this ruleset and are tracked in COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
#   b) Are architectural decisions (e.g. Petri net state machines need
#      high cyclomatic complexity by design)
#   c) Are false positives due to framework patterns
#
# Each exclusion MUST have a paired comment. Undocumented exclusions
# will be removed by the HYPER_STANDARDS reviewer.
#
# Review cycle: quarterly. Owner: architecture team.

# YEngine is the central coordinator implementing the YAWL Petri net semantics.
# Its complexity is inherent to the formalism; decomposition is tracked in
# COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md (target: Q3 refactor).

# YNetRunner executes firing sequences in Petri net markings.
# The switch-heavy state machine is unavoidable for the semantics.

# YPersistenceManager wraps Hibernate Session in a facade.
# API signatures are constrained by Hibernate and cannot be changed.

# YWorkItemRepository holds the in-memory marking of all active work items.
# Field count is bounded by the YAWL specification, not arbitrary growth.

# YSpecification is the root object for a workflow specification.
# It mirrors the YAWL schema structure which mandates multiple fields.
