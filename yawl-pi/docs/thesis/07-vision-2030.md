## 7.2 The 2030 Capability: What Changes

### The Old Model: Design → Build → Run → Monitor → Redesign

```
Process Analyst     designs specification (weeks)
BPM Developer       implements in engine (days)
Data Engineer       builds ETL pipelines (weeks)
ML Engineer         trains and deploys models (weeks)
Operations          runs dashboards, manual escalation (continuous)
Process Analyst     redesigns from dashboard insights (quarterly)
```

Total cycle for one improvement: **3–6 months**.
Human effort per improvement: **4–6 specialists × multiple weeks**.

### The 2030 Model: Declare → Operate

```
Process Owner       declares goal in natural language (minutes)
CPOS               discovers process from historical data (minutes)
                   generates specification (seconds)
                   trains intelligence models (minutes)
                   deploys and begins execution (seconds)
                   adapts continuously (microseconds per case)
                   improves specification autonomously (ongoing)
                   explains every decision on demand (seconds)
Process Owner       monitors outcomes against declared goal
                   adjusts goal if needed (minutes)
```

Total cycle for one improvement: **minutes to hours**.
Human effort per improvement: **one person, one goal statement**.

### The Functions That Dissolve

| Function | 2026 state | 2030 state |
|---|---|---|
| Process design | Human modellers, BPMN tools | NL → CPOS → executable spec |
| Feature engineering | Data scientists, manual | ProcessMiningAutoMl auto-extracts |
| Model training | ML engineers, scheduled jobs | Milestone-triggered, autonomous |
| ETL pipelines | Data engineers, batch jobs | Eliminated (live EventStore) |
| Adaptation rules | Process analysts, static configuration | Learned from outcomes |
| Explanation | Manual audit, dashboard interpretation | On-demand NL via MCP |
| Performance monitoring | Dashboards, human review | Constitutional alignment, auto-correct |

This is not automation of existing process management tasks. It is the **elimination
of the process management function as a manual labour category**, replaced by a
declarative objective specification and an autonomous system that pursues it.

## 7.3 The Economic Argument

### Current Cost Structure

| Component | Annual cost (large enterprise) |
|---|---|
| BPM platform licence | $200K–$1M |
| Process mining platform | $150K–$500K |
| ML platform | $100K–$400K |
| Data engineering (ETL) | $300K–$800K labour |
| Process analysts | $200K–$600K labour |
| **Total** | **$950K–$3.3M** |

### 2030 Cost Structure (CPOS)

| Component | Annual cost |
|---|---|
| CPOS platform licence | TBD (competitive with one of the above) |
| Process owner time (goal specification, oversight) | $50K–$100K |
| **Total** | **~$350K–$1.1M** |
| **Saving** | **$600K–$2.2M per deployment** |

The addressable market: every enterprise that currently buys BPM + process mining +
ML platform — estimated **$15B+ annually**. The CPOS does not take a slice of this
market. It replaces it with a smaller, simpler, dramatically more valuable offering.

### The Ecosystem Play

The CPOS value curve has a network effect component: the more process intelligence
bundles (`.yawl + *.onnx + rules`) are created, the more valuable the ecosystem
becomes for every participant.

A marketplace of process intelligence bundles — pre-trained models and adaptation
rules for specific verticals, shared across organizations — creates a compounding
advantage. The first organization to deploy a high-accuracy fraud detection bundle
for insurance claims benefits every subsequent organization that imports it.

This is the ecosystem moat that makes the Blue Ocean durable.

---

## 7.4 The Research Programme

The CPOS requires advances in six research areas, each of which has a concrete
starting point in the current YAWL PI implementation:

| Research area | Starting point | 2030 target |
|---|---|---|
| **Causal process learning** | Closed learning loop (§6.1) | Unbiased policy improvement from observational data |
| **Federated process intelligence** | `PredictiveModelRegistry` + ONNX weights | Privacy-preserving global learning across jurisdictions |
| **Constitutional process constraints** | `AdaptationRule` + `EventDrivenAdaptationEngine` | Provably enforced hard constraints at engine level |
| **Process digital twins** | `WorkflowEventStore` + `ProcessMiningAutoMl` | Parallel simulation of alternative specs against live traffic |
| **NL process specification** | `NaturalLanguageQueryEngine` + `PIToolProvider` | End-to-end: NL → YAWL spec → trained models → running process |
| **Emergent process optimization** | `ResourceOptimizer` + `AlignmentOptimizer` | Multi-objective autonomous spec improvement with A/B testing |

Each research area is grounded in working code today. The path from current
implementation to 2030 target is continuous — not a research reimagination.
