## The One-Sentence Thesis

Any architecture that separates ML training and inference from workflow execution by a network boundary cannot achieve the classes of adaptive behaviour that require sub-millisecond prediction latency — and co-location is therefore not an optimization but a prerequisite for a new class of system.
