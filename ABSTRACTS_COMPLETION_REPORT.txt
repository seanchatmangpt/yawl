NEXT STEPS FOR PUBLICATION
================================================================================

Immediate (This Week):
  1. Choose primary target venue (academic or enterprise)
  2. Review venue submission guidelines
  3. Select appropriate abstract/summary from list
  4. Customize with institutional affiliations

Short-term (This Month):
  1. Check conference/journal deadlines
  2. Prepare supplementary materials (benchmarks, test coverage)
  3. Draft submission cover letter if required
  4. Submit to target venue

Medium-term (This Quarter):
  1. Monitor submission status
  2. Prepare for peer review feedback
  3. Plan for multiple venue submissions in parallel
  4. Prepare presentation materials

Long-term (This Year):
  1. Target Q3–Q4 2026 publication for venues accepting now
  2. Use published papers in marketing/sales materials
  3. Present at major conferences (SIGMOD, IEEE, etc.)
  4. Build thought leadership in deterministic AI space

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Start with one of these two approaches:

ACADEMIC TRACK:
  → Submit ABSTRACT_ACM_CONFERENCE.txt to ACM SIGMOD/SIGPLAN
  → Submit ABSTRACT_TOSEM.txt to ACM Transactions on SEM
  → Submit ABSTRACT_IEEE_MAGAZINE.txt to IEEE Software
  → Estimated timeline: 2–4 months peer review + publication Q3–Q4 2026

ENTERPRISE TRACK:
  → Use ONE_PAGER_EXECUTIVE.txt in sales decks (immediate)
  → Use EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_FULL.md in investor pitches
  → Customize for target industries (healthcare, finance, government)
  → Generate leads and early adopters

Both tracks can proceed in parallel and reinforce each other.
